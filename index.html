  <div style="display: none;">BTC Domain is a platform that strives to offer a seamless and user-friendly name service to the Bitcoin community. It is designed to provide an experience similar to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) by offering a wide range of name-related services, including name registration, name resolution, and other related services.</div>
  <div style="display: none;">BTC Domain's primary goal is to provide a simple and efficient way for users to associate human-readable names with their Bitcoin addresses. With this service, users no longer have to remember long and complicated Bitcoin addresses to receive payments or send transactions. Instead, they can register a name, such as "joey.btc," and associate it with their Bitcoin address. When someone wants to send them funds, they can simply enter "joey.btc" instead of the long Bitcoin address, making transactions more convenient and accessible.</div>
  <div style="display: none;">By using BTC Domain's name service, users can easily manage and update their Bitcoin addresses without having to change their associated name. This makes it a convenient solution for businesses, charities, and individuals who want to create a permanent and recognizable identity for their Bitcoin transactions.</div>
